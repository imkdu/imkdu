- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin, a Senior Information & Decision Sciences major. 
- You can check out some of my projects through the repositories tab or by clicking here: https://github.com/imkdu?tab=repositories



- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, software developing and all-around just playing around with tech and code. 



<!-- - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my Dispatcher Control Center program. Since it's my first 'big' project and I started it blindly, it introduced me to a whole other side of programming
that I have yet to learn. Each new obstacle I encountered during the project is something new that I learn about. Sometimes the problems lead to other problems that I must address
before fixing my original problem!   -->



Thanks for stopping by!
